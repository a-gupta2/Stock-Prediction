# Stock Prediction Analysis

## Overview

Stock Prediction Analysis is a project that uses machine learning techniques to predict stock prices. The project includes data collection, data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps, all implemented in Python.

## Features

- **Data Collection**: Fetch historical stock price data.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the data for model training.
- **Model Training**: Train machine learning models to predict future stock prices.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance using various metrics.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow (optional, for deep learning models)
- Matplotlib (for data visualization)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/a-gupta2/Stock-Prediction
   cd Stock-Prediction
Create a virtual environment:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
**Usage**
Run the data collection script:

python data_collection.py
Run the preprocessing script:

python preprocessing.py
**Train the model:**

python train_model.py
**Evaluate the model:**

python evaluate_model.py
